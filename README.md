EnvyRState is the join of two principal concepts.

The first one: “Enviousness Real Estate market”, that refers to a perfect and innovative market where you can get all the information you need.

The second one: “R Studio” which is the development environment where our team works.

The main problem is that the information on the real estate market is either quite heterogeneous or it is missing. Moreover, the constant changes in the behaviour of the real estate market make the evaluation of these types of changes very hard for the professionals. So our first objective is to provide a platform that homogenises and collects all these disperse information then transforming them into useful knowledge.

Our app explores a selected set of indicators that can potentially inform on the state of the housing market. To this aim, we decided to split this approach into five dimensions: Housing conditions, Housing prices, Construction, Mortgages and Macroeconomy. Each dimension involves several databases from different sources. Most of them closely related to providing insights about a possible housing bubble.

The main objective of this application is to create a complete tool for visualising and analysing interactively different effects on the environment of the housing market. This tool will provide answers to the general public, experts, investors and even policymakers all information they need to evaluate, analyse and extract conclusions about changes in prices of houses, prices of renting, different macroeconomic aspects, the evolution of the construction or even if a country is more prone to be owner instead of tenant, among others. With the purpose of answering different questions related to the housing market, giving them enough information to determine what the cause of a phenomenon is and helping them to make predictions and take action.
